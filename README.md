# Breast Cancer Detection using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

A machine learning project that applies the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to classify whether a tumor is benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## 📌 Description

This project explores the use of **KNN**, a simple yet powerful classification algorithm, for breast cancer diagnosis. The model is trained and evaluated on the popular **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## 🚀 Features

- Implements KNN from scratch using NumPy
- Supports variable K values
- Calculates accuracy and confusion matrix
- Clean, interpretable code

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn (for dataset loading & comparison)
- Matplotlib (optional for visualizations)

## 📈 Results

- Accuracy: ~95% with K=5 (tuneable)
- Performance improves with data normalization
